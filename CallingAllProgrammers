What if you had a chance to be apart of recreating the world, would you take it?

                       WHERE FANTASY MEETS REALITY
I am 21 years old my name is Gary Wilmot (garywilmot0@gamil.com) and my life hasn't been so simple. 
I won't dive into a detailed story but I will say I see what must be done and I am calling on the General Public 
people who feel as if their life is just on a loop, people who wanna break free and no longer be the sheep but the sheepherders.
I am from Chicago, Illinois. 
All I have is my name, passion, and dream. All I'm told is "it's impossible" and 
"the last person to have a dream didn't get to live to see his dream fulfilled (Martin Luther King Jr) this doesn't discourage me
this motivates me to do the impossible and to keep dreaming
I know that its possible to recreate the world and it will be done and it must be done , its either by us (the General Public), 
or people who already control our everyday lives. 

Jeff Bezos sat down with the owner of Barnes and Noble before Amazon was even launched 
and tried to recruit him to invest and help build Amazon, to my surprise he disrespected Bezos and 
told him to never say that he will be the biggest bookstore (the movie Bezos on Amazon Prime). Now he is literally 
one of the richest people from on Earth. This was all I literally needed to motivate me to no longer be apart of the sheeps,
knowing you can change the world and, actually changing the world is two different things. Life is real and 
i'm not waiting on a lottery ticket, an angel, or anyone else to help me do this I know it will happen.

Anyone wanting to be apart of Fantality, Inc. email me at the address I provided above.
Life is hard and it shouldn't be I aim to change that....
